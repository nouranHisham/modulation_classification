# modulation_classification

Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. It is only natural then to extend 
this communication medium to computer applications. We define speech emotion recognition (SER) 
systems as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect the 
embedded emotions.
